# The Hall/Van De Castle System of Analysis

All the scales in the Hall/Van de Castle system are nominal ones. They assign no ranks or weights. Instead, various discrete categories are compared as equal and aggregate discrete categories for overall scores.


Dream scientists determined that the three categories of characters, social interactions and emotions are the most valuable ones [[59](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C59)] and are usually more informative than all the remaining ones combined. In this work, to test our five hypotheses, we focused on coding each dream report along measures that reflect these three categories ([table 1](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080TB1)).

(i)

_Characters._  People, animals and imaginary figures who appear in the dream report. In addition to determining characters’ types, we classified their gender and whether they were dead.

-   _Male%._  The number of male characters divided by the sum of male and female characters.
    
-   _Animals%._  The number of animal characters divided by the number of all characters.
    
-   _Imaginary%._  The number of fictional or dead characters divided by the number of all characters.
    

(ii)

_Interactions._  Interactions among characters of three types: friendly, sexual and aggressive.

-   _F/C index._  The number of friendly interactions divided by the total number of characters.
    
-   _S/C index._  The number of sexual interactions divided by the total number of characters.
    
-   _A/C index._  The number of aggressive interactions divided by the total number of characters.
    
-   _Aggression._  The number of aggressive interactions divided by the total number of interactions.
    
-   _Aggression/friendliness._  The number of aggressive interactions divided by the total number of friendly interactions.
    

(iii)

_Emotions._  Markers of positive or negative emotions in the dream report.

-   _Negative emotions%._  The ratio between the number of negative emotions and the total number of emotions expressed in the dream.



# Total 10 categories

—

_characters:_  people, animals and other figures featured in the dream;

—

_interactions:_  social interactions among characters (e.g. kissing);

—

_emotions:_  emotions experienced by the characters or denoting the situation (e.g. sadness);

—

_activities:_  physical actions that characters perform and sensory experiences (e.g. smelling);

—

_striving:_  success and failure of characters in carrying out their activities;

—

_(mis)fortunes:_  fortune and misfortunes that happen to the characters, possibly as result of their actions;

—

_settings and objects:_  physical surroundings or objects present in the scene (e.g. outdoors, a weapon);

—

_descriptive elements:_  attributes and qualities of objects, people and actions (e.g. colour, size, speed);

—

_food and eating:_  presence of food or act of eating; and

—

_elements from the past:_  characters or elements belonging to the dreamer’s past (e.g. younger self);

# The Classification and Scoring of Characters

The characters category consists of people, mythical figures, and animals. All three general types can appear as individuals or groups. Thus, "a woman," a "Greek god," or "my favorite kitten" is one character, but so is "a group of women," "three goddesses," or "a litter of kittens.

If the dreamer reports that he or she was "talking with a group of women, one of whom was my mother," we code for both a group (the women) and the individual character who was singled out (the mother).

For human and mythical characters, there are three additional general categorizations: gender, identity, and age. In the gender category, individual characters can be male, female, or "indefinite," with indefinite meaning gender is not identified in the dream report. Groups of characters can be male, female, indefinite, or of both genders (that is, identified in the dream report as a group containing both men and women).

The identity classification of characters concerns such factors as relationship to the dreamer, occupation, ethnicity, and the prominence or celebrity of characters. For example, characters can have the following relationships to the dreamer: immediate family, other relatives, known characters (friends, acquaintances, classmates), and strangers (unknown to the dreamer).

Prominent" characters is a category for famous people who are known to the dreamer by general reputation, but not personally (e.g., leading political figures, famous entertainers, and sports stars). Fictional, dramatic, imaginary and supernatural characters are also included as "prominent" characters because they are familiar to the dreamer by their reputation (e.g., cartoon characters, mythical figures, characters in TV serials). Finally, there is a residual identity coding category called "uncertain" for those characters whose identities cannot be established with certainty from the dream report.

Age is the fourth and final general category after individual/group, gender, and identity. The four age categories are adult, teenagers, child (ages 1-12, or referred to as a child in the dream report), and baby (under age one or referred to as a baby or infant).

Hall and Van de Castle found they could achieve the highest reliability and make the maximum use of all the information in the dream reports if there is a coding for characters even if they are only mentioned ("I told him my dad was a good person."), referred to (e.g., "I told him about my sister's new car."), or thought about ("I wondered how my brother was doing.").

As Appendix A explains, there is a detailed notational system for describing each character in a dream report. "A man I did not know" is a 1MSA, that is, an individual character (1), a male (M), a stranger (S), and an adult (A). "A little baby girl that I knew" would be a 1FKB, that is, an individual character (1), a female (F), a person known to the dreamer (K), and a baby (B). In other words, a coding is assigned to each human and mythical character for each of the four general categories in the order the categories were introduced in previous paragraphs.

Each immediate family member has her or his specific coding symbol, but we will leave most of the details for the appendix. However, we note here that 1MFA is a "father" and 1FMA a "mother" to show how important sequence is. That is, an M in the second position in the sequence means "male," but an M in the third position means "mother;" an F in the second position means "female," but an F in the third position means "father." Such little details of the coding system are slowly learned as one works with it. Once learned, the efficiency and usefulness of the system became apparent. Animals, incidentally, have one generic coding symbol for all of them, which is "ANI." They are coded only for individual or group. Thus, two spiders, three bears, or a herd of buffalo all would be coded 2ANI, and nothing more.



##  The Classification and Scoring of Social Interactions

Three kinds of social interactions are classified in the Hall/Van de Castle system: aggressions, friendliness, and sexuality. Those actions and feelings of characters that are not classified as social interactions are discussed in subsequent sections.

### Aggressive Interactions

It is a deliberate or intentional feeling or act on the part of one character meant to harm or annoy another character. Injury or adversity to a character happening by chance or environmental circumstances does not count.

Most aggressive acts involve a character who is the _aggressor_ and a character who is the _victim_. On occasion, the victim will respond with counteraggression, called _reciprocated aggression_. In cases where there is no clear aggressor or victim, the interaction is coded as a _mutual aggression_. In addition, aggressions can involve the dreamer or merely be _witnessed_ by the dreamer (e.g., "I saw two men fighting."). On rare occasions there is _self-directed aggression_ (e.g., "I was so angry at myself I bit my finger until it hurt.").

As noted earlier in the discussion of nominal and hierarchical scales, there are eight nominal subclasses of aggression. Each class is designated by the letter A followed by a number:

A8:

An aggressive act resulting in the death of a character.

A7:

An aggressive act involving an attempt to harm a person physically, whether through personal assault or with a weapon.

A6:

An aggressive act involving chasing, capturing, confining, or physically coercing another character into performing some act.

A5:

An aggressive act involving the theft or destruction of possessions belonging to a character.

A4:

An aggressive act in which a serious threat or accusation is made against a character.

A3:

An aggressive act in which a character is rejected, exploited, controlled, or verbally coerced through such activities as dismissals, refusals, demands, disobedience, or any other type of negativistic or deceitful behavior.

A2:

Aggression displayed through verbal or expressive activities like yelling at, swearing at, scowling at, or criticizing a character.

A1:

A covert feeling of hostility or anger without any overt expression of anger.


Finally, the sum total of the aggressions in all eight categories can be treated as a general category of aggressions.

These specifics are reserved for Appendix A. There is also a set of coding notations that will be saved for the appendix except for a few brief examples. D A2 > 1MFA says that the dreamer (D) swore at or was critical of (A2) his father (1MFA). By the same token, 2MSA A5 > D says a group of males unknown to the dreamer destroyed or stole one of the dreamer's possessions. We use these shorthand summaries of all the aggressions in a dream set or series to answer such questions as the frequency of the dreamer's involvement in aggressions, the frequencies of different types of aggressions, and the frequency of victimization and reciprocation.

When the scoring of a dream report is done on the kind of scorecard shown in Appendix B, which has separate columns for entering aggressive, friendly, and sexual interactions, there is no need to include the A in the scoring of an aggressive interaction. However, if the scoring is being done in the margins of the dream report, which is more feasible in a day when extra copies can be made easily through photocopying, then the interaction should be scored as D A2 > 1MFA so that it can be readily distinguished from the F2's and S2's to be introduced shortly. We now do most of our coding on photocopies of dream reports to improve ease of checking.

## Friendliness

The coding system for friendliness closely parallels that for aggressions. First, friendliness is defined as a deliberate purposeful act, only this time involving support, help, kindness, gift-giving, or any other type of friendly act toward another character. Second, there is a distinction between involvement and mere  _witnessing_  of the friendly interaction. Third, there are categories for the initiator (the  _befriender_) and recipient (_befriended_) of the friendly interaction, as well as for  _reciprocated_,  _mutual_, and  _self-directed_  friendliness. Fourth, there are several subclasses of friendliness that are defined in Appendix A.

The subclasses of friendship usually are brought together as one overall category of friendliness for purposes of analysis. The notational system is similar to that for aggressions. For example, D F4 > 1ANI means the dreamer helped an animal. D F6 = 1MKA means the dreamer and a known male exchanged slaps on the back or maybe an embrace -- the friendliness was mutual. 1FMA F6 > 1FTA means the dreamer witnessed her mother hugging her sister. The details of how to code for all the intricacies of friendly interactions are once again left for the appendix.

Friendly interactions are usually not as frequent as aggressive ones in dream reports, but they are nonetheless a very useful coding category, especially when they are joined with aggressions for various kinds of comparisons.


## Sexual Interactions

Sexual interactions involve everything from sexual fantasies about a character to sexual intercourse. As with aggressive and friendly interactions, a distinction is made between  _initiators_  and  _recipients_, and there are categories for  _reciprocated_  and  _mutual_  sexual interactions. The dreamer can be involved or a  _witness_, and there is a category for  _self-directed_  sexuality. There are five subclasses of sexual interactions.

The five subclasses of sexual interaction can be added together for one overall "sexual interaction" score, which often is a necessity because there are relatively few sexual interactions in most series or sets of dream reports. Given this tendency to use one overall score, any difficulties in distinguishing among subclasses become a minor matter. The notational system for sexual interactions is the same as for aggressive and friendly interactions. The following is a steamy sexual scene that also shows how we code a sequence of social interactions:


#  The Classification and Scoring of Activities


Activities are defined as anything characters _do_ in dreams, such as run, walk, talk, or think. Activities can be done by one character acting alone (e.g., thinking), in conjunction with other characters (e.g., laughing, jogging), or in interactions between characters (e.g., talking). Although most activities are _not_ social interactions by the definitions used in this coding system, activities and social interactions are not mutually exclusive. For example, an aggression can also be a physical activity (e.g., hitting) or a verbal activity (e.g., scolding). There are eight subclasses of activities. The activities categories can be reduced to a physical activities category and a nonphysical activities category. One overall activities score can be derived by adding the frequencies for all eight categories.

##  The Classification and Scoring of Striving: Success and Failure

Some social interactions and activities involve striving to succeed. The character can "try" to think of a solution to a problem, "try" to fix a fence, or "try" to run from a dangerous character. That is, once a character is described as expending energy and showing perseverance in pursuit of a goal, no matter how trivial the goal is, then the character is involved in striving. If the goal is reached, a "success" is coded. If the goal is not reached, a "failure" is coded. Striving can involve an individual or a group, it can be physical or nonphysical, and it can or cannot be part of a social interaction.

Provision is also made in the coding system for including any aftermath or "consequences" of success or failure. For example, a failure might be followed by a helping hand from another character, which is a friendly interaction as a "consequence" of failure. In practice, we find very few consequences of success or failure.

## The Classification and Scoring of Misfortunes and Good Fortunes

In the preceding three sections, emphasis has been placed upon the various interactions and activities of the characters. They may fight, dance, make love, converse, walk around, look, listen, or struggle to accomplish something. All of these acts involve some deliberate voluntary choice on the part of the character engaging in them. As the result of these acts, characters may be killed, hurt, or defeated, or they may become engaged, popular, or prosperous. These bad and good outcomes are, therefore, the consequences of what the characters have done or attempted to do.

Sometimes bad or good outcomes happen to a character independent of anything he or she may have done. Fate, in a sense, has stepped in and produced certain results over which no character has any control. In the Hall/Van de Castle coding system, these impersonal "fatalistic" events are called "misfortunes" when bad things happen to a character and "good fortunes" when good things happen to a character. A misfortune is any mishap, adversity, danger or threat happening to characters through no fault of their own and without intent of aggression on the part of some other character. The six subclasses of misfortune range from death, accidents, and illnesses to being lost or late. A good fortune is something positive, like finding money or winning the lottery, that happens "out of the blue," by luck. No one "caused" the happy event, nor is it the result of striving by the character. Since good fortunes are relatively rare in dream reports, no attempt was made to create any subclasses for them.

## The Classification and Scoring of Emotions


Emotions are defined as any feeling states explicitly stated in the report as experienced by a dream character. The emphasis has to be on "explicitly stated" because there is a great temptation to infer unexpressed feelings when dreamers describe emotion-arousing events such as falling, being chased, or facing great danger. The only exception to the explicitness rule is if the dreamer describes the kind of autonomic nervous system activity accompanying an emotion in that situation, such as tears upon hearing news of a death (sadness), or sweating and trembling when cornered by a dangerous animal (apprehension).

It is surprising how seldom emotional states are mentioned in dream reports unless they are asked for explicitly, and even then they are not always present. Moreover, most of the emotions fall into one of the four categories of "negative" emotions (anger, apprehension, sadness, and confusion). Pleasant emotional states are so few that there is little need to distinguish between types of happiness. Thus, the five categories turn out to be quite adequate for the limited role they are called upon to play in the quantitative study of dream content.

##  The Classification and Scoring of Physical Surroundings: Settings and Objects

The dream report usually contains physical surroundings that are divided into two very general categories in the Hall/Van de Castle system: settings and objects.

### Settings

Almost all dream reports include some form of recognizable setting, and people frequently begin their reports by saying something about the setting. Just as there are often several acts and scenes to a play, so, too, is it common for the setting to change during the course of a dream narrative, sometimes quite abruptly.

Hall and Van de Castle eventually collapsed all settings into two broad groupings--indoor and outdoor settings. Indoor settings are ones in which the dreamer is in a building or in an area attached to or part of the exterior of a building. Outdoor settings are those where the dreamer is described as being out-of-doors or outside a building, even if in a vehicle or a cave. If the setting cannot be determined with certainly, it is coded as ambiguous. Settings also are coded for their familiarity to the dreamer. There are five levels of familiarity described in the appendix.

### Object


An object is a "thing" having tangibility, palpability, dimensionality, and definite physical boundaries or limits. Intangibles such as air, wind, fog, and sky are excluded by such considerations, as are songs or sounds, which have temporal boundaries but not physical ones. Locations such as cities, streets, rooms, and lakes have physical boundaries and are consequently classified as objects. Persons and animals are not coded as objects because they are handled separately under the classification of characters, but parts of persons and animals are treated as objects.

Since any object we encounter in waking life can be represented in dreams, along with some we would be startled to see with our eyes open, the problem of formulating a system for the classification of objects was a tedious one. The number of possible groupings could be very large if one chose to categorize by reference to size, shape, color, weight, age, composition, ownership, location, function, and other qualities that could readily be suggested. After several arrangements had been tried, Hall and Van de Castle finally settled on a system that includes twelve broad classes, three of which are further subdivided, plus a miscellaneous class. All objects appearing in dreams are therefore classifiable under one of these headings. They are as wide as "nature," "region," and "travel," and as narrow as "food," "body parts," "clothing," and "money." These highly detailed categories are not regularly used in every investigation, but some of them have proven to be helpful in specific instances.

## The Classification and Scoring of Descriptive Elements


In addition to characters, actions, interactions, and emotions in a physical surrounding of settings and objects, dream reports also contain a very wide range of descriptive terms characterizing people and things. Dreamers are in "fast" cars, see "young" men, feel "intense" anger, and perform "gracefully." Dream reports also may refer to a particular time of the day or note that a certain amount of time has passed. They may use negative terms in order to describe what people or things are not (e.g., "not a big car, but a small one"). All of these are called "descriptive elements" in the Hall/Van de Castle coding system, and they are broken into three general categories--the modifier scale, the temporal scale, and the negative scale.


#### The Modifier Scale

The modifier scale consists of adjectives, adverbs, and phrases used for descriptive elaboration. There are nine subclasses. Each of the nine subclasses ranges along a bipolar dimension, so can be coded with a plus or minus sign to indicate which pole of the modifier is present in the dream report. "Size," "velocity," and "intensity" are examples of the modifier subclasses.

#### Temporal Scale

This scale is for (1) specific units of time, such as "a few minutes," "a week," "a long time," or even "the night shift," or (2) references to a particular time for the purpose of dating an event, such as "tomorrow," "early in the morning," "6 p.m.," or "Christmas day." The trick with this scale is not to code age, sequences of events (e.g., after, next), or greetings like "good morning" or "good night."

#### Negative Scale

This straightforward scale is used to code all negative descriptions. Negative descriptions are of two types. First, there are common negative words like "no, not, none, never, neither, and nor." Second, there are a set of negative words formed by the prefixes "un-," "im-," "il-," "ir-," and "non-"; here the rule is that a word is coded on the negative scale if the word "not" could be substituted for the prefix without changing the meaning of the word. For example, "illegal" is "not legal," "inexcusable" is "not excusable," and "improper" is "not proper."

### Food and Eating Scale

The food and eating scale was created due to the possibility that it might reflect the great concern with these issues in industrial urban societies. The scale consists of eating, drinking, the activities leading to eating and drinking, and the surroundings in which these activities occur. The five subclasses can be added together for one overall code.

### Elements from the Past

It is sometimes claimed that the elderly and the psychologically disturbed tend to live more in the past than other people. Some theorists believe that dreams are often about the past or are "regressive" in nature. The Elements from the Past Scale was created so these kinds of claims could be addressed in a quantitative way. There are seven straightforward subclasses that encompass such events as being younger, in locales not recently visited, and seeing someone the dreamer has not visited for over a year.

The Elements from the Past Scale is the final empirical scale in the original Hall/Van de Castle coding system. We now turn to some new developments since the scales were created.

## Dramatic Dream Reports and Unrealistic Dream Elements

We believe that the dramatic intensity of a dream report is best indexed by a simple summation of the number of scores entered in the following seven content categories: aggression, friendliness, sex, success, failure, misfortune, and good fortune.

We believe that the dramatic intensity of a dream report is best indexed by a simple summation of the number of scores entered in the following seven content categories: aggression, friendliness, sex, success, failure, misfortune, and good fortune. For example, a dream report with three aggressions, two friendly interactions, two successes, and two misfortunes would receive a Dramatic Intensity (D.I.) score of nine; a dream report with one occurrence in each of the seven categories would receive a D.I. score of seven; and a dream report with no entries in any of these seven categories would receive a D.I. of zero. This scale was first used by Hall (1966a: chap. 3) in a study comparing dreams collected at home with dreams collected in the sleep laboratory. He found home dream reports tended to be more dramatic than laboratory dream reports. The dramatic intensity scale also was put to use in a study of dream recall (Trinder and Kramer, 1971).

## Psychopathology and Dream Content


1. Friends Percent

First, a lack of friends and acquaintances in dreams, as opposed to an abundance of family members, strangers, and other human character categories, is a potential indicator of adjustment problems, as will be shown later in a case study. This is because people with few friends in their dreams may be unable to develop relations beyond their family. A "lack of friends" is defined as significantly less friends and acquaintances (known characters) as a percentage of all human characters:

Friends Percent  =  known characters  ÷  all human characters

2. F/C Index

Second, a lack of friendly interactions with the characters who appear in dream reports, whether friends, strangers, or family members, is considered a potential indicator of psychological problems. A "lack of friendly interactions" is defined as a significantly low score on an index in which friendly interactions are divided by the total number of characters in the dream reports (F/C). The F/C index also can be figured for specific classes of characters, such as males, females, family members, or strangers.  
It needs to be emphasized that the friends percent and F/C index are very different measures. The first concerns types of characters, the second concerns types of interactions. That is, a person could report friend A and friend B were present in the dream, but not have any friendly interactions with them. Conversely, a dreamer can have friendly interactions with strangers or parents or any other characters in the dream series, not just with friends.

3. Aggression/Friendliness Percent

A third indicator of possible psychopathology, the "aggression/ friendliness percent," is derived by dividing the number of aggressive interactions by the total number of aggressive and friendly interactions. Note that this measure is independent of the number or type of characters appearing in the dream reports. The aggression/friendliness percent can be figured for specific classes of characters, such as friends or strangers, or for specific characters, such as father or mother.

4. A/C Index

Fourth, it is a possible sign of psychopathology if there is a significantly high rate of aggressive interactions with the characters appearing in the dream reports (A/C). This indicator is parallel to the F/C index. As with the F/C index, it can be figured for specific classes of characters as well as for all characters.

5. Victimization Percent

Fifth, it is a possible sign of psychopathology when dreamers are disproportionately victims in the aggressive interactions in their dream reports. This percentage is determined by dividing the number of instances where the dreamer is the victim by the number of instances where he or she is either the aggressor or the victim in an aggressive interaction:

Victimization Percent  =  victim  ÷  (aggressor + victim)

6. A/F Square

An unusual pattern of aggressive and friendly interactions with males and females may be an indicator of possible pathology. This indicator, called an  _A/F Square_, entails findings in a 2x2 table to be explained in chapters 4 and 9

7. Misfortunes

A very large percentage of dream reports with misfortunes in them may be a sign of potential maladjustment. Misfortunes, as noted earlier in the chapter, are basically any negative events in the dream report not caused by a dream character.

8. Low success percent

A very low success percent in striving attempts, in other words, a very high rate of failure, may be an indicator of psychopathology. The success percent is calculated in the same way as earlier percents presented in this section:

Success Percent  =  dreamer-involved successes  ÷  (dreamer-involved successes + dreamer-involved failures)

. Negative Emotions Percent

It may be a potential sign of psychopathology if the "negative emotions percent" is significantly higher than the norm:

Negative Emotion Percent  =  negative emotions  ÷  (negative emotions + positive emotions)

10. Torso-Anatomy Percent

Findings in one clinical case to be presented in chapter 9 suggest that a preoccupation with certain parts of the body may indicate a psychological disturbance in body image. Specifically, we determine a "torso/anatomy percent" based on dividing the sum of the mentions of the torso, anatomical parts, and sexual organs by the total number of all body parts mentioned.

11. Bodily Misfortunes Percent

It may be a potential sign of psychopathology if there are a disproportionate number of "bodily misfortunes," defined as illnesses, injuries, bodily defects, or mental problems suffered by a dream character. The death of a character through illness, injury, or some unknown cause is also considered a bodily misfortune. The bodily misfortune percent is determined by dividing the number of bodily misfortunes by the total number of misfortunes:

Bodily Misfortunes Percent  =  (M5 + M6)  ÷  all misfortunes
